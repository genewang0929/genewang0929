# Hi there, I'm Gene Wang 👋

### Computer Science Graduate Student | Aspiring Backend & Infrastructure Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a software engineer passionate about building robust backend systems, scalable infrastructure, and efficient algorithms. I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science (expected graduation: May 2026) and hold an **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate** certification.

My industry experience spans three software engineering and DevOps internships at **TSMC**, **ITRI**, and **Titansoft**, where I worked on everything from managing large-scale host environments with Ansible and Kubernetes to optimizing data streams and developing full-stack applications.

### 🔭 What I'm Up To
- **Currently building:** **LeTracker**, a custom spaced-repetition system (SRS) for algorithm practice written in Go.
- **Currently learning:** Advanced System Design and distributed systems architecture.
- **Always focused on:** Writing clean, testable code and diving deep into backend infrastructure.
